1. The event is trigged by left-clicking on a tile that is not being occupied by an Entity.

2. A 3x3 region of Snowblocks will attempt to spawn wherever there is a space not occupied by an Entity.
	
	Snowblocks behave similar to Ore; it turns into another Entity.

	Snowblocks have a 20% chance of spawning a Snowman

3a. DiamondVeins will spawn Diamonds instead of Ore but will spawn less frequently.
	
	Diamonds behave like Ore; they will turn into OreBlobs after some time.

3b. When MinerNotFulls turn in 3 Diamonds, they transform into SwordMiners when they turn in Diamonds to the Blacksmith.

	SwordMiners are able to destroy OreBlobs.

	They can do this two times before they turn back MinerNotFulls.

3c. OreBlobs will seek out and destroy DiamondVeins once all Veins are destroyed.

4. The Snowman entity will seek out a Vein. Once it touches a Vein, it will expend its life to make it a DiamondVein
